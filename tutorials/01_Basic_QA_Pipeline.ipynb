It was broadcast on Sunday at 9:00 pm in the United States, consisting of 10 episodes, each running approximately 50–60 minutes. The season mostly covers the events of \\'\\'A Clash of Kings\\'\\', the second novel of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' series by George R. R. Martin, adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. HBO ordered the second season on April 19, 2011, which began filming in July 2011, primarily in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Croatia and Iceland.\\n\\nThe story takes place in a fictional world, primarily on a continent called Westeros, with one storyline occurring on another continent to the east known as Essos. Like the novel, the season follows the dramatic death of Lord Eddard \"Ned\" Stark, with all of the Starks being separated across Westeros. Season two mainly centers around the War of the Five Kings, fought between the leaders of Westerosi factions who are either staking a claim on the Iron Throne, or seeking independence from it.

The publication of ''A Game of Thrones'' caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members , was co-founded in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban descent, Elio M. García, Jr., as well as Linda Antonsson, who introduced him to the series; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.\\n\\nMartin runs an official website and administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck.

During the first scene of the fourth season, as Ice, the Stark sword, is reforged by Tywin Lannister, the Starks' and Lannisters' themes are clearly played simultaneously, to finally end with the Lannister theme only. In the finale of Season 6 with the shot of the armada at the end, at least five themes were combined – themes for Daenerys, Theon, the Unsullied, the dragons, and the main title.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 7}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '4748be2f674df644d9901d30d11ac629'}>,\n",

Rhaenys\\'s husband, however, is the powerful lord Corlys Velaryon, and this estranges the Velaryons from the royal court.\\n\\nKing Viserys, married to Aemma of House Arryn, names their daughter Rhaenyra as his successor, ahead of his hot-tempered and mercurial younger brother Daemon (the titular \"rogue prince\").  This decision contradicts the new inheritance law established at the Great Council, which should put a male heir ahead of any female one, but Daemon\\'s reputation is so scandalous that Viserys\\'s powerful advisor Otto Hightower eagerly goes along with it.

R. Martin, and in their television adaptation \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.\\n\\nIn the novels, High Valyrian and its descendant languages are often mentioned but not developed beyond a few words. For the TV series, linguist David J. Peterson created the High Valyrian language, as well as the derivative languages Astapori and Meereenese Valyrian, based on the fragments given in the novels. Valyrian and Dothraki have been described as \"the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish\".\\n\\n==High Valyrian==\\n\\nIn the world of \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\', High Valyrian occupies a cultural niche similar to that of Latin in medieval Europe.  The novels describe it as no longer being used as a language of everyday communication, but rather as a language of learning and education among the nobility of Essos and Westeros, with much literature and song composed in Valyrian.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '938c434659d8090eac962266bbac1cae'}>,\n",

Peterson, creator of the spoken Valyrian languages for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\\nTo create the Dothraki and Valyrian languages to be spoken in \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', HBO selected the linguist David J. Peterson through a competition among conlangers. The producers gave Peterson a largely free hand in developing the languages, as, according to Peterson, George R. R. Martin himself was not very interested in the linguistic aspect of his works. The already published novels include only a few words of High Valyrian, including \\'\\'valar morghulis\\'\\' (\"all men must die\"), \\'\\'valar dohaeris\\'\\' (\"all men must serve\") and \\'\\'dracarys\\'\\' (\"dragonfire\"). For the forthcoming novel \\'\\'The Winds of Winter\\'\\', Peterson has supplied Martin with additional Valyrian translations.\\n\\nPeterson commented that he considered Martin\\'s choice of \\'\\'dracarys\\'\\' unfortunate because of its (presumably intended) similarity to the Latin word for dragon, \\'\\'\\'\\'. Because the Latin language does not exist in the fictional world of \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\', Peterson chose to treat the similarity as coincidental and made \\'\\'dracarys\\'\\' an independent lexeme; his High Valyrian term for dragon is \\'\\'zaldrīzes\\'\\'. The phrases \\'\\'valar morghulis\\'\\' and \\'\\'valar dohaeris\\'\\', on the other hand, became the foundation of the language\\'s conjugation system.

Both prepositions and postpositions are used to form other cases; for example, the ablative is formed with the preposition \\'\\'hen\\'\\' + the locative (e.g. \\'\\'hen lentot\\'\\', \"from a house\") while the superessive is formed with the postposition \\'\\'bē\\'\\' following the genitive (e.g. \\'\\'lento bē\\'\\', \"on top of a house\").\\n\\nThere are four grammatical genders, which do not align with biological sex.

It is possible to tell which paradigm is in use from the first person plural indicative—consonant stems will always end in ''-i'', whereas vowels stems will end in ''-ī''. Verbs with stems ending in a vowel follow a pattern where that stem-terminal vowel might change—''-a'' and ''-i'' do not change, ''-e'' becomes ''-i'', but ''-o'' and ''-u'' both become ''-v''.

The cities of Slaver\\'s Bay speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages.

In an attempt to undermine the Tyrells, as well as release her son from his marriage to Margaery Tyrell, Cersei attempts to frame Margaery for adultery and treason. However, this plot backfires as the investigation into Margaery reveals evidence of Cersei's own adultery and Cersei's complicity in Robert's death, resulting in her arrest by the Faith.

R. Martin conceived The Red Wedding during the earliest stages of the planning of his saga, when he was envisioning a trilogy with The Red Wedding as one of the climactic events at the end of the first of the three books.

One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the \"Black Dinner\", where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful Clan Douglas to a feast at Edinburgh Castle.

He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he \"forced himself\" to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\\n\\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark\\'s heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.
